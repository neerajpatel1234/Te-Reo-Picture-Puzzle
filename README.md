# Te-Reo-Picture-Puzzle 

## Description 
This picture puzzle game uses Te Reo Maori words and sayings. The game was made by me as a personal project to learn JavaFX and more about the Maori language and culture. Using several different resources, I was able to create a game that is both fun and educational.

The result of my research into Te Reo Māori language and culture is this picture puzzle game. Attempting to create an immersive and informative experience, I incorporated Te Reo Māori words and phrases into the game mechanics. As a side project, it gave me the chance to learn more about JavaFX and hone my graphical user interface programming skills while also learning more about Maori culture.

In the end, the outcome is a game that cleverly blends learning and enjoyment, giving users a vibrant platform to connect and have fun with Te Reo Māori. In addition to honing my technical abilities, this endeavour helped me understand more deeply about rich cultural history of New Zealand
