# Te-Reo-Picture-Puzzle (in progress)

## Description 
This picture puzzle game uses Te Reo Maori words and sayings. The game was 
made by me as a personal project to learn JavaFX and more about the Maori language and culture.
Using several different resources, I was able to create a game that is both fun and educational.
