# Te-Reo-Picture-Puzzle

## Description ---------------------------------------------------------------
This is a picture puzzle game that uses Te Reo Maori words and proverbs. The game was 
made by me as a personal project to learn JavaFX and to learn more about the Maori language and culture.
Using a number of different resources, I was able to create a game that is both fun and educational.
